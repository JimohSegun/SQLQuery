# Introduction 
This project delves into COVID-19 data, focusing on two different datasets: COVID-19 vaccination and COVID-19 deaths. It emphasizes the data analyst role and includes the following analyses:

- Likelihood of dying if you contract COVID-19 in your country.
- Percentage of the population infected with COVID-19.
- Countries with the highest infection rate compared to the population.
- Countries with the highest death count per population.
- Continents with the highest death count per population.
- The continent with the highest death count per population.
- Global numbers.
- Percentage of the population that has received at least one COVID-19 vaccine.
And so on.

# Background
Motivated by the need to analyze COVID-19 data more effectively, this project was initiated to identify:
- The likelihood of dying if you contract COVID-19 in your country
- The percentage of the population infected with COVID-19
- Countries with the highest infection rate compared to the population
And other related analyses


### The questions I wanted to answer through my SQL queries were:
 Likelihood of dying if you contract COVID-19 in your country.
- Percentage of the population infected with COVID-19.
- Countries with the highest infection rate compared to the population.
- Countries with the highest death count per population.
- Continents with the highest death count per population.
- The continent with the highest death count per population.
- Global numbers.
- Shows Percentage of Population that has recieved at least one Covid Vaccine
